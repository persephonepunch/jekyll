This site is to demonstrate the simlarity of Jekyll and Muse [ysl150.com](ysl150.com) 

The base was set up with [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/ "html5 boilerplate") and [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ "normalize.css") as a starting point. I can incorporate Angular, React and a number of libraries I config in the YAML front matter. This front matter can also be set up in the MUSE to BC workflow I use for prototyping. The file links to a custom [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/ "modernizr") library that isn't used in the final build but is available if you need it.
